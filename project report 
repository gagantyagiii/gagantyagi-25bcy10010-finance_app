 Expense Tracker – Project Report

Submitted by: Gagan Tyagi — 25BCY10010



1. Introduction

Many times we spend money casually and later forget where it all went. Especially as students, it becomes difficult to track daily personal expenses. To solve this everyday problem, I developed a simple Python-based Expense Tracker application.

This project helps store everyday spending details so that a person can check and control their expenses more effectively.




2. Aim of the Projec

The main purpose of this project is:

To record daily expenses in a simple format

To store the entries permanently using a database

To allow users to view their spending history whenever required


This project encourages better financial habits.



3. Tools Used

Python 3 – to write the main program

SQLite – to store the data in a database file

VS Code – as the development environment


The project works completely offline.



4. Working of the System

The program creates a database file named transactions.db.
In this database, a table is created to store:

Expense title

Amount spent

Date of expense


Whenever a new entry is added:

1. The user inputs the details


2. The program stores the entry in the database


3. All previously saved entries can be viewed anytime



The working is straightforward and practical.



5. Project Outcome / Learning

Through this project, I learned:

How Python interacts with databases

Writing and executing SQL queries

Storing and retrieving real-time data

Understanding data organization in applications


This hands-on experience made database concepts much clearer.


6. Output Description

After entering the expense details, the program confirms that the data is saved successfully.
The user can then display the list of all stored expenses neatly.
This helps in clearly understanding where the money has been spent over time.

7. Advantages

Very easy to operate

Data remains saved permanently

No internet connection needed

Helpful for daily expense tracking


8. Future Enhancements

There are many improvements that can be added:

Categories such as food, travel, shopping, etc.

Charts and graphs for visual analysis

Exporting data to Excel or PDF

A graphical user interface or a mobile app


With further development, it can become a complete budgeting tol.


9. Conclusion

This project gave me a good understanding of Python and database integration.
It also made me realize the importance of keeping track of expenditures.
Even though the application is simple, it serves a real-life purpose and can be expanded with more features in the future.
